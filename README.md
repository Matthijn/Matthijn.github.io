# Portfolio

The source of my portfolio website on [matthijn.com](matthijn.com)

## Dependencies
Normally I do not include packages managed by a package manager in the repository, however in this case I need it so static hosting on [matthijn.github.io](matthijn.github.io) can find the right files. (Hey, free hosting ;) )
